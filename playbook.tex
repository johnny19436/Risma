\section{Introduction}
This playbook outlines the key components and advanced, compute-intensive techniques that can be implemented in a modern market risk management software solution. The focus is on delivering accurate risk measures, meeting regulatory requirements, and enabling real-time risk analytics using emerging technologies.

\section{Monte Carlo Simulation for VaR and CVaR}
\subsection{Objective}
Develop a simulation engine that generates a large number of market scenarios using advanced multivariate models, enabling accurate calculation of Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR).

\subsection{Key Techniques}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Monte Carlo simulation with Gaussian copulas and well-specified marginals.
    \item Parallel processing via multi-threading, GPU, or FPGA acceleration.
    \item Aggregation of profit and loss (P\&L) scenarios to derive risk measures.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Steps}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define risk factors and model their statistical distributions.
    \item Develop and optimize the simulation engine.
    \item Implement aggregation algorithms to compute VaR and CVaR.
